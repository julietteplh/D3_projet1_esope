      <p>Ésope est considéré comme le créateur du genre de la fable. La dette de La Fontaine est immense. Les textes de l'auteur grec, généralement plus courts que ceux de son continuateur français, ont une visée bien plus humoristique. La morale est évidemment toujours présente, mais relève plutôt du comique de situation. Ce sont de petits textes en prose sans visée littéraire et dont le style est plutôt familier. Esclave pendant un temps, Ésope est aussi grand voyageur. La légende voudrait qu'il se soit rendu chez Crésus, le roi de Lydie, pour lui conter une fable dans le but de conserver l'indépendance de Samos, son île natale.

    <h1>The Kingdom of the Lion</h1>
      <p>
        The beasts of the field and forest had a Lion as their king. He was
        neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a king
        could be. During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general
        assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a
        universal league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the
        Kid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should live together
        in perfect peace and amity. The Hare said, “Oh, how I have longed to see
        this day, in which the weak shall take their place with impunity by the
        side of the strong.” And after the Hare said this, he ran for his life.

    <h1>The Lion And The Mouse</h1>
    <p>
        A lion was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising
        up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse
        piteously entreated, saying: <s^p))pm^ùmp:)!pan class="quote">“If you would only spare my life, I would
        be sure to repay your kindness.”</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Lion laughed and let him go. It happened shortly after this that the
        Lion was caught by some hunters,
        who bound him by strong ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing
        his roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free,
        exclaiming:

        <span class="quote">“You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting
        to receive from me any repayment of your favor; now you know that it is
        possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.”</span>

    <h1>The King’s Son and the Painted Lion</h1>
    <p>A king, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream in
        which he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion. Afraid the
        dream should prove true, he built for his son a pleasant palace and
        adorned its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized
        animals, among which was the picture of a lion. When the young Prince
        saw this, his grief at being thus confined burst out afresh, and,
        standing near the lion, he said: “O you most detestable of animals!
        through a lying dream of my father’s, which he saw in his sleep, I am
        shut up on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl: what
        shall I now do to you?”.</br>

    </br>With these words he stretched out his hands
      toward a thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he
      might beat the lion. But one of the tree’s prickles pierced his finger
      and caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young Prince fell
      down in a fainting fit. A violent fever suddenly set in, from which he
      died not many days later.</br>

    </br>We had better bear our troubles bravely than try to escape them.</p>

    <h1>The Lion and the Shepherd</h1>
    <p>A lion, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn. Soon afterward he
        came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail as if to
        say, “I am a suppliant, and seek your aid.” The Shepherd boldly examined
        the beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his lap,
        pulled it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into the
        forest.</br>

    </br>Some time after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false
        accusation, was condemned “to be cast to the Lions” as the punishment
        for his imputed crime. But when the Lion was released from his cage,
        he recognized the Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead of
        attacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap. The King, as
        soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set free again in the
        forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and restored to his friends.

    <h1>The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant</h1>
      <p>The lion wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints. “It is true, O
        Jupiter!” he said, “that I am gigantic in strength, handsome in shape,
        and powerful in attack. I have jaws well provided with teeth, and feet
        furnished with claws, and I lord it over all the beasts of the forest,
        and what a disgrace it is, that being such as I am, I should be
        frightened by the crowing of a cock.” Jupiter replied, “Why do you blame
        me without a cause? I have given you all the attributes which I possess
        myself, and your courage never fails you except in this one instance.”</p>

      <p>On hearing this the Lion groaned and lamented very much and, reproaching
        himself with his cowardice, wished that he might die. As these thoughts
        passed through his mind, he met an Elephant and came close to hold a
        conversation with him. After a time he observed that the Elephant shook
        his ears very often, and he inquired what was the matter and why his
        ears moved with such a tremor every now and then. Just at that moment
        a Gnat settled on the head of the Elephant, and he replied, “Do you see
        that little buzzing insect? If it enters my ear, my fate is sealed. I
        should die presently.” The Lion said, “Well, since so huge a beast is
        afraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor wish myself dead. I
        find myself, even as I am, better off than the Elephant.”
